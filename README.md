# expressJs server

This is my first ExpressJS server and it was a really good experience

### What I did in this repo

Made a simple calculator for the calculating BMI ( BODY MASS INDEX ) 

## RUN

- Clone the project.
- ` cd ` inside the `/api` directory.
- `npm install`
- run the server with : ` node ./calculatorServer.js` or you can install `nodemon` with ` npm install -g nodemon` to monitor changes easily and then run it with `nodemon ./calculatorServer.js` 

- Head to `localhost:3000/bmiCalculator` and enter height and weight and see the result.
